# Initial Code Coverage Report

**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Tool:** `grcov`
**Initial Coverage:** 0.00%

## Files Analyzed

- `src/main.rs`

## Summary

The initial code coverage for the `mdlt` project is 0.00%. This is because no tests have been written for the project yet. The entire `src/main.rs` file, which contains all the logic for file analysis, is untested.

## Next Steps

A plan will be devised to add unit tests to the project to increase code coverage to at least 98%.
